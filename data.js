  FOUNDERS FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT 26/27 — EDIT YOUR TOURNAMENT HERE
  ============================================================

  This is the ONLY file you need to edit for normal updates.

  1. Change team names/badges/colors in teams.
  2. Add/remove players in players.
  3. Add fixtures/results in matches.
  4. Refresh the website.

  IMPORTANT:
  - A match with a score is treated as completed.
  - A match without homeScore/awayScore is upcoming.
  - Standings are calculated automatically from completed matches.
  - Player goals are calculated from the scorer lists in matches.
  - Optional: give a team group: "y12" (Group 1) or group: "y13" (Group 2) to get
    separate group tables and the knockout bracket. Knockout matches use
    stage: "sf-y12", "sf-y13" or "final" (normal matches need no stage).
